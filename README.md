This repo is a follow along to the Coursera Data Science Fundamentals and R course. I'll be using this repo to learn how to stage and push / pull commits to a project.

The primary purpose of this repo is not that I need to host this project, but instead to farmiliarize myself with Version Control of the use of Git / GitHub.
